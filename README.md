### üßëüèª‚ÄçüíªHi, I'm Matteo Batticani


I am a fullstack developer who creates digital products using many modern tools, I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Catania, I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives.

Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have developed a solid foundation in programming concepts, software development methodologies, and best practices for building high-quality, scalable applications.
One area in which I particularly excelled is the back-end, using nodeJS and Larvale as tools.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and collaborator. I am always eager to learn from others and share my knowledge and expertise to help create innovative solutions that exceed expectations.
